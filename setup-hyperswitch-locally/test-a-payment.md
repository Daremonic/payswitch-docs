## Test on web client <a href="#user-content-create-a-payment" id="user-content-create-a-payment"></a>

Once you have successfully run the web client, you should be able to test the payments.

After running the web client, you will see the demo web app (playground) running on `http://localhost:4242` where you can test your payments.

Congrats! you have successfully tested an end-to-end payment with your own app server and a web client.

The app server is more powerful than just processing the payments. You can test refunds, subscription payments and more using the app server.
