## Production ready deployment

### This setup includes:

| Component       | Instance Type  | Default Configuration |
| --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| EKS (1 Cluster) | t3.medium      | 2 Nodes               |
| Load Balancer   | Application LB | 2 LBs                 |
| RDS             | t4g.medium     | 1 cluster             |
| ElasticCache    | t4g.medium     | 1 cluster             |

The following services will be installed in the 2 Nodes inside your EKS cluster

| Service Name           | Number of Pods                              | Default Configuration                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |

| Producer (Scheduler)   | 1 pod                                       | <p>CPU : 100m<br>Memory : 100 Mi</p> |
| Consumer (Scheduler)   | 2 pods                                      | <p>CPU : 100m<br>Memory : 100 Mi</p> |

## Steps to Deploy PaySwitcher on AWS

### **What do you need to get started**

* An AWS user account with admin access (you can create an account [here](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/registration/index.html?refid=em\_127222) if you do not have one)
* `git` installed on your local machine

<details>

<summary>Optional - Create a new user with Admin access (if you do not have a non-root user)</summary>

Follow the steps mentioned in this [guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_users\_create.html#id\_users\_create\_console) and create a new user in your AWS account. While setting permissions, provide admin access to the user as shown below

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (68).png" alt="" data-size="original">

</details>

#### Step 1 - Configure your AWS credentials in your terminal

For this step you would need the following from your AWS account

1. Preferred AWS region
2. Access key ID
3. Secret Access Key
4. Session Token (if you MFA set up)

You can create or manage your access keys from `IAM > Users` inside your AWS Console. For more information, [click here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id\_credentials\_access-keys.html#Using\_CreateAccessKey)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-11-02 at 5.48.06 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Once you have the keys run the below command

```json
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<Your AWS_REGION> // e.g., export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-2
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<Your Access_Key_Id> // e.g., export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<Your Secret_Access_Key> // e.g., export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="<Your AWS_SESSION_TOKEN>" //optional
```

#### Step 2 - Deploy PaySwitcher application

Run the below commands in the same terminal session

```bash
git clone https://github.com/payswitcher/payswitcher-cdk.git
cd payswitcher-cdk
sh install.sh
```

Once the script is run you will have to configure the following

1. DB password (should be more than 8 chars)
2. Admin Api key for PaySwitcher APIs&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure to save the passwords you provide while running the script
{% endhint %}

On successful execution of the script, you will receive the following outputs

| Output                      | What is it used for                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hostname of the app server  | Access the application's APIs using the given base URL                                                                        |
| Hostname of the log server  | View real-time logs for all processes                                                                                         |
| Control Center URL          | Access the PaySwitcher control center and explore multiple settings                                                           |
| Hyperloader.js URL          | Use the `hyperloader` to [integrate our web client](../../going-live/integrate-web-client-on-your-web-app.md) in your website |
| Demo App URL                | Test payments quickly using our web checkout in the demo store                                                                |

{% hint style="success" %}
That's it! PaySwitcher should be up and running on your AWS account

Verify the health of the application by hitting `http://<host>/health`. The expected response is 'health is good'
